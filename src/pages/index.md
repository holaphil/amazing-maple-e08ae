        content: >
          With over 20+ years experience (**15 years working in Product
          Management roles**), I've spent a majority of my career working in
          collaboration with engineers, data analysts, designers, and
          researchers to **identify the best most creative ways to solve complex
          problems** for our clients and customers. I have many years experience
          turning novel ideas into innovative products.

        content: >
          Empathy for the user (customer or client) is not a nice to have —
          **empathy is a requirement**. I make the time necessary to appreciate
          the challenges our users face so that, together with my entire team,
          we **build the products that serve the best interest of our
          customers**. Happy customers equal repeat customers ergo happy
          clients, partners, investors.
      - title: Unify teams
        content: >
          Throughout my career, I've both founded businesses building teams and
          products as an **Entrepreneur** AND developed new products and
          services within larger organization as an **Intrapreneur**. In either
          example, I am well versed on the organization and management required
          to collaboratively develop, launch, and market products that deliver
          immediate value for both a business and its customers.

          Having managed the branding and marketing of several **early stage
          startups** as well as packaged and managed the launch of new products
          and services inside **larger growth organizations**, I have built and
          grown brands that connect with their audience.

          I've watched Phil build several products and each time the execution
          on that product displayed of level of vision for the future few people
          possess. I have a deep level of respect for Phil's work and his
          thinking.
