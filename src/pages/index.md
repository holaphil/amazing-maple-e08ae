      If you look around the web, you may notice every place you exist, your
      content and data is stored on a platform you do not own. Of course these
      third party platforms provide purpose and value; however, at the end of
      the day you are still living in someone else's house.


      **holaphil.com is my house**. Here you will find a resources and
      information related to my 20+ years of experience building brands,
      products, and services. Take a tour by simply scrolling further down or
      selecting any of the nav items above. Thanks for visiting!


      PS — this website is built using an architecture called **Jamstack**.
      Designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale,
      Jamstack is what helps these pages load incredibly fast. What's not to
      love about that! If you're a closet nerd like me or just curious, you can

        content: >
          With over 20+ years experience (**15 years working in Product
          Management roles**), I've spent a majority of my career working in
          collaboration with engineers, data analysts, designers, and
          researchers to identify the best most creative ways to solve complex
          problems for our clients and customers. I have many years of
          experience turning a novel idea into an innovative product.

        content: >
          **Empathy** for the user (customer or client) is not a nice to have,
          it **is a requirement**. I make the time necessary to appreciate the
          challenges they face so that, together with our entire team, we build
          the right products that serve the best interest of our customers.
          Happy customers equal happy clients, partners, investors.
      - title: Unify teams
        content: >
          Throughout my career I have had the pleasure building teams and
          products as an **Entrepreneur** and connecting people to build new
          products and services as an **Intrapreneur**. In either case, I am
          well versed on the management required to collaboratively develop,
          launch, and market products that deliver immediate value for both a
          business and its customers.

          Having managed the branding and marketing of several **early stage
          startups** as well as packaged and managed the launch of new products
          and services inside **larger growth organizations**, I know what is
          required to build brands that connects with their audience.

          on that product displayed of level of vision for the future few people
