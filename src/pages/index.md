    title: Hola!
    content: >
      Thanks for stopping by my personal website, holaphil.com. I spun this site
      up using Jamstack, an architecture designed to make the web faster, more
      secure, and easier to scale. What's not to love about that! If you're a
      closet nerd like me or just curious, you can learn more about Jamstack
      here.


      Now that we got that part out of the way, let's get started.

      - title: Solve problems
        content: >
          With **15+ years working in Product Management roles**, I've spent a
          majority of my career working in collaboration with engineers, data
          analysts, designers and researchers to identify the best most creative
          ways to solve complex problems for our clients and customers. I have
          years of experience taking a novel idea and turning that idea into an
          innovative product.
      - title: Unify teams
        content: >
          Throughout my career I have had the pleasure building teams as an
          **Entrepreneur** and connecting people as an **Intrapreneur**. In
          either case, I am well versed on the types of collaboration required
          to develop, launch, and market products that deliver immediate
          business value.
      - title: Stand up for the customer
        content: >
          **Empathy** for the user (customer or client) is not a nice to have,
          it **is a requirement**. I make the time necessary to appreciate the
          challenges they face so that, together with our entire team, we build
          the right products that serve the best interest of our customers.
          Happy customers equal happy clients, partners, investors.
      - title: Build brands
        content: >
          Having managed the branding and marketing of several **early stage
          startups** as well as packaged and managed the launch of new products
          and services inside **larger growth organizations**, I know what is
          required to build brands that connects with their audience.

          on that product displayed of level of vision for the future few people
          possess. I have a deep level of respect for Phil's work and his
          thinking.
