## WellcomeMat.com

WellcomeMat was born in a garage (yes a real garage) back in 2005. I co-founded the company and spent six years running product and marketing while managing develop and design teams based in Boulder, CO and Brooklyn, NY.

I wanted to spotlight how startups (and also larger funded businesses) build great products. Today, Product Council is an event series where designers, entrepreneurs, and product managers gather to solve the world’s greatest product challenges.

# Pegshot

Pegshot was a mobile startup I co-founded in 2009. Our idea for this business came as a result of a mobile video service our team initially built for Wellcomemat. At the time, we had created a mobile app for our users to shoot video and then upload on WellcomeMat. Videos could be tagged immediately with relevant local MLS information and then shared online. With Pegshot, we simply broadened the concept to support video AND photos tagged to places as opposed to property.
