As a **Principal Product Manager**, I managed the design, development, and operational scaling for all **video ad formats** across AOL’s publisher ecosystem (e.g. Huffington Post, Techcrunch, Tumblr, etc). This role included product management with a **core team of 10 including designers, developers and QA engineers**. In addition to video ad formats, I managed new ad format engagements with Verizon's product leadership to help ideate, develop, and launch **new innovative mobile ad formats**. Format experimentation included **ad innovations in e-commerce, mobile payments and data sharing**.

<HR>

**Problems I worked on:**

*   **How can we upgrade and advance our existing product line of video ad formats** to provide the sales team a more competitive offering for their clients/brands?

<!---->

*   **How can we develop best-in-class products offering compelling new forms of digital advertising** taking advantage of Verizon’s unique device and network footprint?

<!---->

*   **How can we grow our mobile footprint generating greater advertising revenue** for our first-party publishers while also providing utility and value for the consumer?

<HR>

**Achievements:**

*   **Oversaw a complete rebuild of AOL’s video and mobile interactive ad format product portfolio** including code and design rewrites and significant upgrades in format capability/scale (transitioning from Flash to HTML5).

<!---->

*   **Managed design and development for new interactive video formats** including Verizon Media's first interactive 360 Video and non-linear VPAID ads

<!---->

*   **Led engagements with Verizon product leadership testing new innovative mobile ad formats** which took advantage of Verizon’s unique device and network footprint. One example is Verizon’s ‘Buy Now Button’, a mobile ad format which provides consumers the ability to connect their VZ account and purchase products or services in one tap on their mobile device. **(**[**view demo here**](https://youtu.be/6PHpFMCARt0) on YouTube) These experiments later led to further e-commerce integrations for video.

<!---->

*   **Built and scaled multiple products helping AOL’s sales team advertise and sell additional video inventory.** Two industry celebrated examples include AOL’s ‘[Player Up](https://martech.org/aol-brandbuilder-ad-format-suite-launch/)’ and ‘Pause Ads. ([**view demo here**](https://youtu.be/BsdrMzrHrT4) on YouTube) Player Up offered consumer’s the ability to opt-in to learn more at any time while leveraging dynamic creative capabilities providing both brands and publishers persistent brand exposure across the lifetime of a video, regardless of which publisher that video was rendered. AOL’s ‘Pause Ad’, another non-intrusive ad format, provided AOL’s sales team additional inventory to both target and sell.

> “Player Up delivers a suite of video ad experiences in a customer-friendly way, while aligning directly with premium content. Built with clients in mind, and tested with consumers prior to launch, this launch is a testament to AOL's continued commitment to video innovation.“

> – Marla Natoli, Director of Video and Mobile @ AOL

*   **Introduced and oversaw** **consumer-centric product user research programs** with AOL’s User Research Lab in Dulles, VA. Working in close coordination with product and design teams, I owned and operated  user feedback sessions helping test and validate new ad products.
