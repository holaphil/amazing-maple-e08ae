I am a product leader, builder, innovator with over 20 years experience creating and managing products inside design and development organizations. Equally comfortable working with startups (pre/post seed, funded) and large corporate environments. Throughout my career I have served various roles working as a builder, founder and executive â€” in every case, facilitating the creation of products that deliver value to both customers and the business. Self-motivated, equally creative and technical, extremely detail oriented, and driven to deliver results.
