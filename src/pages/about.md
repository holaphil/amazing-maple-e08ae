I am a multi-disciplined product leader, founder, and brand builder with over 20 years of experience successfully innovating within startups and large organizations. Throughout my career I have served various product and executive roles both as an Entrepreneur and an Intrapreneur — in every case, I have managed teams and products that deliver tangible value to both the customer and the business. I am self-motivated, equally creative and technical, extremely detail oriented, and driven by an insatiable desire to innovate and bring new ideas to life.
