FrameSocket is for Content Owners and Developers.

FrameSocket *helps direct traffic for your videos back to your domain* as opposed to ceding traffic to a third party domain (i.e, YouTube, Vimeo). Embed your Framesocket Video Gallery on your domain, give us the URL, and we’ll point all traffic to your domain.

FrameSocket's *turnkey API engine powers media integration* for development teams and businesses of any kind. Quickly implement video and photo uploads, custom CDN’s, encoding, hosting, and distribution into your products.

FrameSocket is a *content management (library) tool* for content owners. Gather videos from an unlimited amount of users and sources.

FrameSocket is *completely plug & play*. Partners can integrate their own players, hosting, advertising and analytics at their discretion.

FrameSocket offers *video search/tagging technology* which helps content owners chapter videos like a DVD. This is tremendously useful for long formatted content.
