As Senior **Product Manager**,  I managed the product roadmap for Tremor Video’s VideoHub service (a Demand Side Platform -- DSP), largely for the managed service side of the business. My work included the identification, prioritization and subsequent management of new product features/enhancements across a team of distributed design, engineer and QA resources located in three different time zones (e.g. Singapore, San Francisco, New York). Within this role, I served as a voice of our customers (e.g. ad trafficking teams) helping improve both our platform experience for the ad trafficking teams and platform performance for our clients and partners. Key product domains included management for video ad trafficking, viewability, audience, inventory and cross-device targeting.

> "Phil brought a level of sophistication to the video space and has a wealth of innovative product ideas and different perspectives on solving user problems. With his background in design, he was a collaborative product manager and came armed with ideas on usability. His ability to articulate and lead product strategy, along with his passion and drive made him a thoughtful player on our team." —

Core clients included...

<!---->

*   **Product Marketing**:  Partnered with product marketing to identify, develop, and later promote new product features for clients and unlock additional incremental revenue for the company.

Problems I worked on...

*   **How can we build smarter faster products using Artificial Intelligence (AI)** where decisions are based on performance as opposed to perception?

*   **How can we enhance the performance of our platform** through the integration of new third-party tools and services?

*   **How can we improve the user experience of our platform** while ensuring the continual development and maintenance of an experience our user's are accustomed to?

Achievements...

*   **Led successful new commerce collaborations with product teams across both Yahoo and AOL teams** working with product management and development leadership within Verizon’s data insights, ad serving and publisher CMS platforms. One such initiative included tools for self-publishing products for sale within video content.

<!---->

*   **Led all phases from conception to launch of Verizon’s first location based mobile commerce ad format (Mobile Wallet)**, a new ad format that delivers offers and content directly into the consumer's mobile wallet. This new format immediately **generated more than 500k of revenue** for the company and led to significant client interest in other innovation ad formats.

<!---->

*   **Original co-founding member of Verizon Media’s Innovation Council**, a team building an innovation pipeline for piloting innovative ad experiences for Verizon’s clients and brands.

<!---->

*   **Co-developed a product innovation scoring matrix to help reward innovation while avoiding unnecessary risk.** Our scoring measured the integration and operational readiness of each new product prior to launch, including Verizon’s first mobile wallet and new video commerce tools resulting in greater network publisher compliance and demand from sales. This tool also helped Verizon Media to postpone or retool several innovation projects to help mitigate and manage risk.
