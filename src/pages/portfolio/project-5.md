I formed the Product Council in 2013 with my then co-host, Tami Reiss. The inspiration came to me after spending multiple years in the NYC startup community. I found that many if not most startup themed events targeted how startups are funded, as opposed to how they are made. I wanted to focus a spotlight on how startups (and larger funded businesses) build a great product. 

Today Product Council is an event series where designers, entrepreneurs, and product managers gather to solve the world’s greatest product challenges. We exist to provide entrepreneurs and agencies a fresh new outlet for critical feedback, ideation, and improvement of their products. Past presenters include product leadership from Spotify, Google, The New York Times, The Skimm, and Vimeo to name a few. Each event features about 100+ guests. Events are currently hosted by our gracious host, Betaworks Labs located in downtown Manhattan.
