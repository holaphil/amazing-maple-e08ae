I formed the [**Product Council**](https://productcouncil.org/) in 2013 with my then co-host, [**Tami Reiss**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamireiss/). After investing many years traveling around the NYC startup community, I found that a majority of the product themed events focused on the business and viability of a startup — none focused on how products are made. The Product Council would become a vessel for spotlighting how startups (and also larger funded businesses) build great products. Motivated by the same interests, Tami and I organized and kicked off our first event back in August of 2013 at HUGE Agency in Brooklyn, NY. Supercharged coming off the success of our first event, we continued with additional events growing the Product Council to become one of the most lauded product themed events in NYC.

> Hands down the best place for product owners to get live, in-person feedback from experts in the field.”

Today, Product Council is an event series where designers, entrepreneurs, and product managers gather to solve the world’s greatest product challenges. We exist to provide entrepreneurs and agencies a fresh new outlet for critical feedback, ideation, and improvement of their products. Past presenters include product leadership from **Spotify**, **Google**, **The New York Times**, and **Vimeo** to name a few as well as startups including **Ergatta**, **Daily Harvest**, **Casper** and **The Skimm**. Each event features about 100+ guests. I have partnered with an amazing team at [**Coalesce**](https://coalesce.nyc/) to help organize and produce each event. Events are currently hosted by our gracious host, [**Betaworks Labs**](https://www.betaworks.com/) located in downtown Manhattan.
