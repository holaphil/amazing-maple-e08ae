**I formed the Product Council in 2013** with my then co-host, [**Tami Reiss**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamireiss/) . The inspiration came to me after spending multiple years in the NYC startup community. I found that many if not most startup themed events targeted how startups are funded, as opposed to how their products are made. I wanted to spotlight how startups (and also larger funded businesses) build great products. Motivated by the same interests, Tami and I organized and kicked off our first event back in August of 2013 at HUGE Agency in Brooklyn, NY. Supercharged coming off the success of our first event, we continued with additional events growing the Product Council to become one of the most lauded product themed events in NYC.

Today, Product Council is an event series where designers, entrepreneurs, and product managers gather to solve the world’s greatest product challenges. We exist to provide entrepreneurs and agencies a fresh new outlet for critical feedback, ideation, and improvement of their products. Past presenters include product leadership from **Spotify**, **Google**, **The New York Times**, and **Vimeo** to name a few as well as startups including **Ergatta**, **Daily Harvest**, **Casper** and **The Skimm**. Each event features about 100+ guests. I have partnered with an amazing team at [**Coalesce**](https://coalesce.nyc/) to help organize and produce each event. Events are currently hosted by our gracious host, [**Betaworks Labs**](https://www.betaworks.com/) located in downtown Manhattan.
