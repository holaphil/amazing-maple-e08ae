About this role...\<!---->

As a **Principle Product Manager**, I managed new product innovation within Verizon Media's content studio team, RYOT Studio. This team was responsible for creating next-gen content across multiple media platforms including **video**, **mobile**, **AR**, and **VR**. My mandate was to \*\*identify and drive operational innovations \*\*for RYOT’s team of 25+ content creators, creative directors, business analysts, and account executives. During my time in this role, my work extended across multiple product design, development, and data teams while **leading all phases of product design, development**, and delivery including conception, user testing, and launching. I also served as RYOT's product lead for Verizon Media's sales, operations, and publishing teams.
