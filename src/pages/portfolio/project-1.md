About this role...

As **Chief Product Officer**, I own the product strategy, roadmap, and execution of NOW//with’s consumer, brand, and talent platforms.  NOW//with creates and curates new forms of social commerce for consumers by integrating talent, ecommerce, and video into a seamless unified shoppable experience. The majority of my time and energy focused on the following three areas of our business: Product, Partnerships, and People.

> "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." -Antoine de Saint-Exupery

*   **Product**: I lead a team of developers, designers, producers, and data scientists while overseeing the strategic, creative, and technical execution of our platform roadmap all the way through delivery, including concept, testing, and launch.

<!---->

*   **Partnerships**: I manage product discovery, research and activation for all client and brand partner platform integrations including but not limited to API, CMS, video, and data services.

<!---->

*   **People**: I recruit and onboard new talent while providing leadership and mentorship for a team of first and third-party product managers, designers, and developers.

Problems I worked on...

\[ FOR THE CONSUMER ]

*   **How can we identify and build best-in-class products** fusing talent, premium content, and products through a unique combination of ecommerce and video (live and on-demand)?

*   **How can we create a compelling consumer journey that converts visitors into repeat customers** starting with discovery all the way through the funnel to conversion?

*   **How do we test and fine tune our products through data-driven decisions that rapidly improve engagement and conversion**, especially in scenarios where those products have not yet been tested with a large subset of consumers?

*   **How do we balance the need for innovative growth strategies** while ensuring our products are exposed to a subset of users that can provide useful insights?

*   **While in the midst of a global pandemic, how can we develop new innovative practices** for the production of shoppable video content with celebrity talent?

\[ FOR THE TEAM ]

*   **How do we build and scale products while managing multiple teams** across both first and third-party design and development resources?

*   **How do we identify and activate development and design resources that deliver immediate results** today while accounting for growth and scale tomorrow?

*   **How can we build flexible solutions that allow our business to innovate?** For example, how can we deliver e-commerce at scale within video while empowering partners to do the same?

*   **How do we manage the demands (founders, partners, investors) for an early stage startup** while ensuring the business remains on track and on task with a consistent strategy?

\[ FOR OUR PARTNERS ]

*   **How can we build products and services that scale and seamlessly integrate** with publishing partners and products?

*   **How do we concept, test, and launch scalable solutions** for our platform while empowering our partners with related products that do the same for their platform(s)?

*   **How can we help talent, brands, and publisher partners generate new incremental streams of revenue** from their fans and consumers across both their O\&O platforms and social channels?

*   **How can we onboard, integrate and sync hundreds of products and brands** to make them shoppable across a library of first and third-party live and on demand video content?
